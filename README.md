This is a teaching repository for the 2016 SDAL students in Git.

Daniel is teaching the students.

I am making another edit.

People who are not here today: Adrienne, Jessica, Emily, Sam, and Millie :'(

Dan's last day of teaching is very soon.
His last topic will be on shiny dashboards
I hope people come to this
